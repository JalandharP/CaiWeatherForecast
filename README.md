Node side source codes of CAI weather forecast app shown in the video (https://youtu.be/tOlYWKifhUI).

If you would like to use this source code for your application, replace the following code by your own APPID provided by https://openweathermap.org/.

[File: server -> routes.js]
const appID = "(Replace to your APP ID)"


### !!! CAUTION !!!
~~Currently the URL (https://www.metaweather.com/static/img/weather/) to get the weather icon is unavailable. 
This URL is assigned to the variant "weatherIconURL" & "weatherIconPngURL" in this example. 
Because I cannot handle the API provided by https://www.metaweather.com, sorry but I cannot help you. 
So please find the other weather icon provider, or create the icon (image files) by yourself and use it.~~
<br>
**=> Currently there is no problem to access above API and the application works well and get icon images as expected.**
